## Subject identification

The files subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt contain the subject identification, I read the data and named the unique column as "id".

## The Activities

The file activity_labels.txt has the codification of the activities and the description of the activities. I named:

CodeAct: "the codification of the activities (first column)"
Activity: "the description of the activities (first column)"

The files y_train.txt and y_test.txt contain the activities codifications and I named "CodeAct".

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Measurements variables

The files X_train.txt and X_test.txt has the numeric data (measurements variables) for trainig and test respectively.

The file features.txt contain the description of the measurements variables. I used it to named the variables but I replaced:
"," by "."
"(" by "."
"-" by "."
"(" by "."
")" by "."
for a good names.

## Final Tidy Data

I joined subject, activities and measurements of training and test, separately. Then, I join training tidy data and test tidy data.


## Results

I putted the mean and standard deviation of every measurement variable in the dataframe "vars mean_sd".

I putted the mean of every measurement variable by activity in the dataframe "ActData".


Thank you!
